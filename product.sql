('Anti Viral Medicine-1', 'Generic Crestor Tablet(Atorvastatin)', 'images/Anti Viral Medicine/atorvastatin-250x250.jpg', 'Anti Viral Medicine','Generic Crestor Tablet are manufactured in hygenic condition from our well known manufacturer. <br> May also be used to prevent certain types of heart and blood vessel problems in patients with risk factors for heart problems. <br> Generic Crestor Tablet or Rosuvastatin is used together with a proper diet to lower cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) in the blood. <br>This medicine may help prevent or slow down medical problems, like atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), that are caused by fats clogging the blood vessels. <br>
<b>Attributes:</b><br>
a) Rosuvastatin belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins. It works by blocking an enzyme that is needed by the body to make cholesterol, so this reduces the amount of cholesterol in the blood. <br>
b) LDL (low density lipoprotein) also known as "bad cholesterol". LDL carries cholesterol from the liver to cells. <br> If too much LDL is carried, more than the cells can use, there can be a harmful accumulation of LDL, which raises the risk of arterial disease. Human blood contains about 70% LDL - although this can vary. <br>
c) Generic Crestor, like other statins, prevents the production of LDL by suppressing HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme in the liver that plays a crucial role in cholesterol production. By doing this, the medication helps prevents coronary artery diseases, and other cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack, stroke and angina. <br>
d) Crestor can lower LDL production by up to 52% (at 10 mg dose compared to 7% with placebo), according to pharmaceutical company Astra Zeneca.The company adds that for greatest results, Crestor treatment should be accompanied by a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol and regular physical exercise. <br>
e) HDL (high density lipoprotein) - also known as "good cholesterol". <br>According to experts, HDL protects us from arterial disease; it takes cholesterol away from cells and returns it to the liver, in effect doing the opposite of LDL. Cholesterol is either broken down in the liver or expelled from the body as waste. <br>
f) Generic Crestor or Rosuvastatin also raises blood levels of HDL. <br>

<b>How should Bimat be used for growing eyelashes?</b><br>
-You should use your Bimat eye drops 0.03% once nightly, by applying one drop to an applicator brush and drawing the brush along the line of the base of the upper eye lashes of each eye. <br> Do not apply to the lower lid and avoid touching other areas with Bimat eye drops, as this may result in unwanted hair growth. <br>Before applying your Bimat eye drops, ensure that your face is clean and makeup and contact lenses are removed. <br> You should begin to see results within 8 weeks with maximum eyelash growth by 12-16 weeks. <br>If you stop using your Bimat eye drops, your eye lashes will return to their original condition, within a few weeks or months. <br>

('Skin Care Medicine-9', 'Hepcinat 400mg Tablet', 'images/Skin Care Medicine/hepcinat-400mg-500x500.jpg', 'Skin Care Medicine','Hepcinat 400mg (Sofosbuvir) is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of hepatitis C virus NS5B polymerase&ndash;the key enzyme mediating HCV RNA replication. <br>Sofosbuvir is a prodrug and after ingestion it is rapidly converted to GS-331007, the predominant circulating drug that accounts for greater than 90% of the systemically active drug. <br> The compound GS-331007 is efficiently taken up by hepatocytes, whereby cellular kinases convert GS-331007 to its pharmacologically active uridine analog 5&apos;-triphosphate form (GS-461203). <br>This triphosphate compound mimics the natural cellular uridine nucleotide and is incorporated by the HCV RNA polymerase into the elongating RNA primer strand, resulting in chain termination. <br>The active form GS-461203 targets the NS5B catalytic site and acts as a non-obligate chain terminator. <br> The active compound (GS-461203) does not inhibit host DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, or mitochondrial RNA polymerase. <br>
Hepcinat is available as a 400 mg tablet. <br> The recommended dose of sofosbuvir is 400 mg taken orally once daily, with or without food. <br> The 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir should be used, regardless of the patients genotype and prior hepatitis C treatment experience. <br> No dose adjustment is needed for mild-to-moderate renal impairment or with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. <br>
Hepcinat has been very well-tolerated in clinical trial. <br> The most common adverse effects observed with sofosbuvir, when used in combination with ribavirin, have been fatigue and headache. <br> Sofosbuvir is pregnancy category B. <br>
The major concern with drug interactions exists with medications that are strong inducers of intestinal P-gp, such as rifampin and St. Johns wort, since these compounds may significantly lower sofosbuvir and GS-331007 levels. <br><b> The coadministration of sofosbuvir with the following medications is not recommended because these medications may significantly lower sofosbuvir levels: </b><br>
a) Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, oxycarbazepine, and phenytoin<br>
b) Antimycobacterials:  , rifampin, rifapentine<br>

('Weight loss medicine-2', 'Orlistat Tablet', 'images/Weight loss medicine/orlistat-500x500 (1).jpg', 'Weight loss medicine','This medicine is in a class of medications called lipase inhibitors that works by preventing some of the fat in foods eaten from being absorbed in the intestines which is removed from the body in the stool. <br> We are engaged in trading and supplying a comprehensive range of Orlistat Capsules that is used with an low-calorie, low-fat diet and exercise program to help people lose weight rapidly. <br> Overweight people who may have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease can also use this medicine. <br>
<b>For use of this drug kindly note the following points:</b><br>	
a) Orlistat is usually taken three times a day with each main meal that contains fat. Take orlistat during a meal or up to 1 hour after a meal. <br> If a meal is missed or does not have fat, you may skip your dose. Follow the directions on your prescription or the package label carefully, and ask your doctor. <br> Take orlistat exactly as directed by the doctor<br>
b) You should evenly divide the amount of daily fat, carbohydrates, and protein you eat over three main meals. <br> If you take Orlistat with a diet high in fat (a diet with more than 30% of the total daily calories from fat), or with one meal very high in fat, you are more likely to experience side effects from the medication. <br>
c) While you are taking this, you should avoid foods that have more than 30% fat<br>
d) When eating meat, poultry (chicken) or fish, eat only 2 or 3 ounces (55 or 85 grams) for a serving. <br> Choose lean cuts of meat and remove the skin from poultry. <br>Fill up your meal plate with more grains, fruits, and vegetables. <br> Replace whole-milk products with nonfat or 1% milk and reduced- or low-fat dairy items. <br>
e) Cook with less fat. Use vegetable oil spray when cooking. <br> Salad dressings; many baked items, and prepackaged, processed, and fast foods are usually high in fat. <br> Use the low- or nonfat versions of these foods and/or cut back on serving sizes. <br>When dining out, ask how foods are prepared and request that they be prepared with little or no added fat.<br>
f) Orlistat blocks your bodys absorption of some fat-soluble vitamins and beta carotene. <br>Therefore it is highly recommended that, when you use Orlistat you should take a daily multivitamin that contains vitamins A, D, E, K, and beta-carotene. <br>Take the multivitamin once a day, 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking orlistat, or take the multivitamin at bedtime. <br>
g) Orlistat may cause side effects such as: <br>
h) Oily spotting on underwear or on clothing. <br>
i) Gas with oily spotting<br>
j) Urgent need to have a bowel movement
k) Loose stools<br>
l) Oily or fatty stools<br>
